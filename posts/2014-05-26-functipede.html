<p><a href="https://github.com/ublubu/functipede">functipede</a> is a set of tools for composing flow graphs in JavaScript. I model all flow graphs (even single nodes) each as a set of input callbacks and a set of output callbacks. This makes it simple to compose a flow graph from smaller pieces. In addition to graph composition, I’ve implemented tools for creating both stateful and stateless nodes/graphs from functions.</p>
<p>Source code: <a href="https://github.com/ublubu/functipede">functipede</a></p>
<p>I’ve been working with Robert Timpe on implementing a C++ game engine as a flow graph. I think it might be possible to use C++ template metaprogramming to make Intel TBB’s flow graph library easier to use by making graph composition look like function composition. I wrote functipede as a quick prototype to see if I actually wanted to write flow graphs that way.</p>
<p>I used functipede for a few days, but I found it very difficult to keep track of the edges in and out of a graph. The abstraction seems usable, but the tooling is definitely not. I think something like Unreal Engine 4’s Blueprint graphical scripting might be what’s needed to make graph-building code fun.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE:</em> Later on, I came across <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(computer_science)">arrows</a> and an associated syntax implemented for Haskell. I haven’t tried it yet, but I would like to use Yampa (arrowized functional reactive programming) for a game one day.</p>
